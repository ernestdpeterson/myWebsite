## Google Maps API Mashup With KnockoutJS and a Map Quest satalite view of locations

Welcome to the project that has caused me more problems than all the others combined! Any one of the requirements in the rubric would have been easily accomplished on it's own but getting all of them to work together at once has be been a major headache. 

The purpose of this app is to display a full page map with location markers and list of locations (and make me pull all my hair out). 

I took the "full page" pat rather literal because I didn't scroll down to see the pictures of the project in the rubric. :-)

### Instructions

Open ko.html in your browser.
Use click buttons in top left of the screen to refine the list of locations. (**note!** not all location types are represented in the list.)
Click on the button of the location you are interested in to see reviews from Google Reviews. 
Click on the marker icon to see a street view of the location.
