                &emsp;Thank you for visiting my site. It has been a very interesting, and rewarding, journey for me to build it. The practical application of the Front End Wed developer course, which I am taking through Udacity, has furthered my understanding of the course materials greatly. It has been fun for me and it turned out to be more of a challenge than I had anticipated, making it ever more fun and educational.<br>
                &emsp;I was born in Litchfield, KY and currently live in Pensacola, FL. My current career is truck driver but after nearly thirty years, and having been to almost every state in the USA, I am seeking a new challenge.<br>
                &emsp;I enjoy the creative and technical process of web development and am looking forward to starting my new career as a Web Developer.
