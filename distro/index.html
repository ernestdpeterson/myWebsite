                &emsp;Thank you for visiting my site. It has been a very interesting journey for me to build it. The practical application of my knowledge has furthered my understanding of the course materials at Udacity greatly. It has been fun for me and it turned out to be more of a challenge than I had anticipated taking the Front End Wed developer course.<br>

                &emsp;I enjoy the creative and technical process of web development and am looking forward to starting my new career as a Web Developer.
